       "   '\"Monster Problems\" has action, fantasy, comedy, survival and even love. It is a film for the whole family, but it manages to be quite tense, especially in action scenes involving monsters.The characters are excellent. Dylan O\\'Brien proves once again that he can be a one-man show, Michael Rooker is great as \"Michael Rooker survival samurai\"; and the dog is just fantastic. Other secondary characters also do not fail.The design of the creatures is perfect; and adorably scary. And the main theme of the film, which basically tells the story of a person leaving the suffocating comfort of his hiding place to find something that makes him happy, in the midst of a pandemic of monsters, I think it is something that will touch the sensitivity of many people that now live the dramas of self-isolation.It\\'s the best post-apocalyptic film I\\'ve seen in a long time, a pleasant surprise that came out of nowhere, and I recommend it to everyone, even the cynics.I give this movie 8 stars out of 10.',\n",

It turned out to be one of the more memorable and entertaining of movies that I have seen in 2020 - and I watch a lot of movies.The storyline told in \"Monster Problems\" was pretty straight forward, but it was at the same time a very interesting storyline that definitely appealed to me in many ways, especially since I have always enjoyed a good creature feature. And with the sheer size of the creatures in \"Monster Problems\", then I was in for quite the treat.Sure, you can say that the main plot was somewhat sappy and a bit on the simplistic side, perhaps appealing more to a younger romantically hazed audience. But the combination of the sappy romance, mixed with the action, suspense and monstrous creatures actually made for quite an enjoyable cocktail.Visually then I was without a doubt impressed with how \"Monster Problems\" turned out. The creature designs were just spectacular and they looked very realistic in the way they moved, behaved and appeared. So the CGI team definitely delivered some nice eye candy with this movie.The acting in the movie was good, and was definitely impressed with the performance of lead actor Dylan O\\'Brien. I was not familiar with him, but he was really great in this movie. I think it was a shame that Jessica Henwick and Michael Rooker weren\\'t given more screen time, because they brought a lot of good things to the movie with their performances and their characters. And the dog Dodge (playing Boy), well he was just spectacular, what a well-trained dog, and it had such great on-camera presence.I can warmly recommend that you take the time and effort to sit down and watch \"Monster Problems\", because this movie was great. I was genuinely surprised and entertained with what writers Brian Duffield and Matthew Robinson managed to deliver.My rating of \"Monster Problems\" is a sure eight out of ten stars. This movie deserves a sequel, no question about it.',\n",

It is also not predictable as you think, you are gonna be surprised especially in the last half hour ,it will go in a different direction in a very good way. Also it does carry a message and it is not just a pointless fun movie.

Enough to be added to my list of favorites for sure. The main character - thank god - is actually likeable, unlike so many protagonists before. The romance, despite being integral to the plot, isn't forced or overwhelming. The characters actually respond to traumatic events accordingly instead of brushing it all off like nothing happened (perhaps it could have been done a little better but at the end of the day it's a rather light movie). And perhaps most importantly - it's chock full of super cool monsters, with an adorable canine companion as the cherry on top. Definitely check this out if you get the chance!

Throw in a dog for his companion and you really want to root for him. There is satisfying character growth. He got his start in Teen Wolf but I didn\\'t see him until The Internship and then his breakaway role in The Maze Runner.\\nThe exposition at the beginning of the movie is pithy and helpful to understand the conditions of the new, dystopian world.

The dog named \"Boy\" always held on to a red dress. I thought for sure Joel would find the owner of the dress and that she would be his true love, like Tom Hanks in the movie Cast Away That would have been sweet, right? Instead, we never learn anything about the owner of that red dress, so it\\'s just assumed she was eaten by monsters.\\nThere are some missing details, but none of them are super important.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!',\n",

Which the film does give a brief introduction about how the monsters originated and mutated. Without giving away details. His girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick) is in another colony 40 miles away. Which Joel plans to get up from underground to go on a journey to reunite with her. He comes across a dog. And two others Clyde (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt). Learning survival tips. And how to face his fears.It is an adventure coming of age kind of story. Its a bit fantasy. Action. Sci fi. And a little bit of a love story without getting too sappy into that genre. It is sure as a lot of fun. The script delivered making Joel as a lovable character who is a bit of a runt in his colony. Where he sticks out as the least productive person. While everyone is mastered in surviving and fighting monsters. Seeing him come up from underneath and clueless on where to go is a lot of fun. The direction plays a little like zombieland mixed with a little bit of a road apocalypse film like Mad max but in a family friendly version of it.The film does have some exciting action sequences with them escaping from monsters and fighting back. The visual effects are great. The music score was good. The film does have a climatic battle on the beach with a giant like crab of a monster.Dylan O'Brien did great playing the character. Adding emotional depth to his journey in reuniting with his love. After feeling isolated from losing his family. And being separated from Aimee. Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt did good too. Jessica Henwick was also great playing in a brief role.It is a fun family adventure apocalypse film that delivers heart. Action. Adventure and a bit of humor.\",\n",

The basis felt like 'Zombieland' crossed with 'The 100' & this film had lessons (like Zombieland had Rules) & in The 100 they needed to know if the ground was survivable. In this, after 7 years of living underground, going outside is a massive task. The adventure is just a whole lot of fun, Dylan does an incredible job especially with his comedic timing which I didn't know he had. The scenes with Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt)) & Clyde (Michael Rooker) who he meets on the way are great additions & add so much to the film. Boy (the dog) is such a hero & worth watching just for him! Overall I think this film is a whole lot of fun with a ton of heart & about living, growing & not being afraid of what might happen. Just live a day at a time.\",\n",

Special effects are awesome. I liked the background music and sound effects. The main actor Dylan O'Brian was awesome. In general, I recommend this movie to adventure genre fans.\",\n",

The section with Rooker and Greenblatt is a fun winning adventure. That is the best of the movie. The rest is somewhat average at best. It starts with a questionable premise. There is a convoluted info dump leading to a questionable premise in the bunker. There are a few undercooked ingredients in the stew. Once he gets outside and joins others, it can literally breath fresh air. It leads to another problem in the movie. The middle works so well that the last act falls a bit flat.

       "   'The most unexpected thing about \"Love and Monsters\" is how charmingly enjoyable it is throughout. Whether it\\'s the well-fleshed out characters (the dog being the clear standout with probably the best arc in the whole movie), the fun monster slayings, or the amusing happenstance luck of the self-deprecating protagonist, there\\'s not much left to hate in this otherwise simple movie.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: A catastrophe mutates and enlarges all the bugs on Earth who then wipe out 95% of the human population. Seven years into the apocalypse, a hopelessly love-struck dork named Joel sets out across a dangerous Earth to reunite with the girl from his past.THE GOODEST STUFF: The pacing is tight, meaning there isn\\'t a single scene that doesn\\'t drive the story forward or develop the characters in some way. Nobody feels wasted, and the script gives you a real good sense of what each person is like, even if they\\'re playing to somewhat of a stereotype (like the smart-mouthed 8-year-old survivalist girl whose all the amounts of plucky we\\'ve seen before, and yet still a scene-stealer.)And can I say how refreshing it is to see a post-apocalyptic movie like this where every human isn\\'t a murdering bastard who is just out for his or herself? The humans in this movie are actually helpful to each other, you know, in the way that most humans are in emergency situations. Imagine that!Surprisingly, the movie pulls off several tonal shifts that are quick and well-executed. You\\'ll be laughing one moment, terrified the next, and then almost in tears after certain flashbacks bare a character\\'s soul in an unexpectedly touching way. It\\'s the best kind of rollercoaster ride because it hits all the right emotional beats, even if, in the end, it does feel kind of small.Which is probably my biggest complaint...THE WORSTEST STUFF: \"Love and Monsters\" feels like it has a much bigger world to explore than the 80+ miles of terrain our hero journeys across. I mean, it\\'s not like a ton more exposition is necessary, but the story alludes to other survivors out there and hints at an ending that we don\\'t really get to see. Its story is essentially a VERY small piece of what looks like a much bigger puzzle. It\\'s not enough to ruin the movie by any means, but the \"smallness\" is enhanced by a couple of hasty editing choices and a third act that feels a bit tacked-on when there is more interesting stuff to explore.CONCLUSION: \"Love and Monsters\" is sincere in its sweetness without being sickeningly so. It\\'s got a great sense of humor, an extremely likable cast, and a fresh take on the post-apocalypse genre. It\\'s the perfect feel-good movie for 2020 with a clear message that may or may not have been intentional: enough hiding; it\\'s time to get out there and live your life.',\n",

Not being a hero (but he can cook and draw!) he's lucky to meet a guy named Clyde (Michael Rooker as a non-villain) and a young girl named Minnow. They both teach him how to survive this nasty world. He also finds a dog named Boy that will accompany him on his journey. Just in time he reaches the colony of his girlfriend...Of course, Love and Monsters is no Oscar material but the acting is good (Dylan is charming and I love Michael Rooker), the deserted world looks cool and the monsters are not scary, but fun. The dog looks fake sometimes, though. Storywise there are also some nice little surprises (the robot!).

Why has the child in you had to disappear because society tells you to grow up? You can be mature and still have a bit of fun and let the child out every so often\\nAnyways, this movie was good fun. Not the best plot, but it's an adventure. The monsters are a bonus and in my opinion are well designed. The main character is ok, but the dog steals the show. The end scene was a bit over the top but it reminded me of the old monster movies like Clash of the titans and Sinbad. This brought back lots of childhood memories for me. Don't take the movie too serious. It's good fun.\",\n",

Now, I\\'m not exactly the fan of family-friendly feel-good movies or any such thing, but I do love me some imaginative and well-done movies, no matter what genre.\"Love and Monsters\" is at least very entertaining, at best even a very inspiring and unique movie in these times. Is the plot original? Not really. The premise? Nah. But I hope you know the secret: you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel to make a good and entertaining movie. Take a nice script and a great director, take out all the identity politics that you might feel tempted to throw in, and trust that it\\'ll be fine. And fine it is indeed. The world building is nothing short of impressive here, just visually. This film is an example of how you can create an absolutely convincing world without tentpole budgets, and it\\'s done by creative decisions all the way. Just like in \"Dredd\", you will find that some nice establishing shots are enough to create immersion. However, that doesn\\'t mean that the more complex creature shots aren\\'t pretty good as well. Compliments to the filmmakers for making the budget count - there wasn\\'t a single shot that took me out of the movie, not one.As for the acting, there wasn\\'t a single actor that was bad. Everyone was decent at least, but some were outstanding - like Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt. Their screentime is limited, but they\\'re pretty much the best characters in the movie. I would love to see a spin-off with those two, to be honest, and I haven\\'t felt like that in a long time. Dylan O\\'Brien does a great job as well, and with some dialogue tweaks it would have been even better. But who am I to complain? Well done, indeed!If anything, I would have given the whole script one or two more drafts to sort out some of the dialogue, but yeah, that\\'s probaly just me.So, if you want to see some nice post-apocalyptic love story with a wholesome twist, some amazing dog acting performances and a really nice score, coupled with some visuals that are actually almost too good for this budget, then dive right into it.

       "   '\"Love and Monsters\" starts off as a teen romance interrupted by the apocalypse, but thankfully becomes much more than that and ultimately very entertaining.There is a welcome trend recently in apocalyptic movies (possibly due to the ongoing pandemic) of finding originality vs. defaulting to a zombie plague.Former \"Teen Wolf\" and \"The Maze Runner\" star Dylan O\\'Brien is an affably geeky guy that stumbles into the hero role. The monster scenes balance decent special effects with fun action.I would have liked to see more of the beginning\\'s \"life in the bunker\" setup as it would likely have given the movie more emotional depth.But overall this is a very enjoyable family-friendly adventure.',\n",

       "   \"Of all the films that I've watched over quarantine, Love and Monsters is the one that deserved to play in a theater.Directed by Michael Matthews from a script by Brian Duffield (who wrote The Babysitter and wrote and directed Spontaneous) and Matthew Robinson (Monster Trucks), this movie creates an interesting world from the first frame, a place where an asteroid almost hits the Earth, but nuclear weapons destroy it. However, the fallout transforms any cold-blooded animal into a mutated monster and within days, most of the human race is dead.This all takes place seven years before this movie, on the night that Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick). After reconnecting with her via the radio, he decides to leave behind the bunker where he's spent his life and cross the dangerous world left behind to find her.Joel has no survival skills at all, mostly acting as the cook for his group. Once he gets to the outside, he's quickly saved and taught what he needs to know by Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt). Then, he's on his way, seeking true love, which he learns the meaning of once he gets to Aimee's settlement.If you have older kids who aren't frightened by big monsters, this is a great movie. I'll give you a small spoiler and let you know that Boy the dog survives, if you worry about that like I do.Originally titled Monster Problems, this has moments of true beauty amongst the monster mayhem, such as when the Mav1s robot plays music for our hero and luminescent jellyfish float through the air.I would more than recommend this movie and hope for a sequel. It was an absolute blast and a real escape from the issues of the world, as all good movies are.\",\n",

It was belivable in the sense that the characters were all so human, the dialoge was great and so was the acting. I first saw Dylan O'briens acting in Teen Wolf, and since then I've wanted to see him get to use his talent. He was good in maze runner, and in american assasin, but here he SHINES. Every single muscle in his face just sells thw preformance to me, he is there, in a world of monsters. And that dog was really cute too. Only thing I wish it would've been longer and that we get to see more of minnow and the survivalist guy. It's not a mind blowing concept or something I will remember for the rest of my life, but it is a good friday night movie to watch with friends or family. I need a sequel.\",\n",

On its surface, it appeared to be a very run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic film, but I do like Dylan O'Brian and the reviews were fairly strong.It succeeded my expectations and currently cracks my top ten of the year. O'Brian is fantastic as always, but the journey his character goes on was remarkable. That's down to the writing, but O'Brian managed to pull it off with ease. The supporting cast was also great, but we didn't really spend much time with anyone apart from O'Brian's character, Joel.The effects were astonishing, making the world feel realistic and lived-in. I liked the narrative a lot, but I feel like an extra fifteen minutes could have easily been added to a couple of key areas. The pacing wasn't entirely there for me, but it was a far cry from being bad and I liked that something was always happening.There were also a couple of questionably convenient things that happened, and real-word logistical issues. Aside from those negatives, which don't detract from my score a lot, I was floored by this film.I have already touched on the writing, but I can't stress enough how incredible it was. There were also some surprisingly touching moments. A sequel was definitely hinted at with the closing scene, so I hope it comes to fruition.Love and Monsters is constantly exciting, the action is great, it has a neat twist, amazing effects, brilliant writing, and it was compelling throughout. I cared about the characters, which made me thoroughly invested in Joel's journey.If you haven't seen Love and Monsters, please check it out. I can't recommend it enough.SCORE: 90%\",\n",

The premise of those adventures centered on embarking on a perilous quest to save the princess (or girlfriend). In this case, the perilous quest involved avoiding huge mutated insects that have taken over the world. Our hero had plenty of room to grow along his journey, since he started out as the least likely to survive two minutes on the surface let alone 7 days.I decided to rent this movie because \"the girlfriend\" was played by Jessica Henwick. Henwick starred as one of the \"Sand Snakes\" in Game of Thrones. She was also the only bright spot for me in the \"Iron Fist\" series.Some of the best moments are when our hero meets up with a man and an 8 year old girl who teach him \"the rules of survival\". His dog \"Boy\" was also totally awesome.I enjoyed going along for the ride in this movie. It gave me 108 minutes of escapism where I didn\\'t have to worry about politics or anything in our real world. It had an excellent third act, and if I was in a theater I may have applauded some.

       "   'Love and Monsters is a movie where I just watched it because it had \"Monsters\" in the title. I love monster movies and since new movies coming out are rare, I gave it a watch. The premise is simple \"Seven years after the Monsterpocalypse, Joel Dawson (Dylan O\\'Brien), along with the rest of humanity, has been living underground ever since giant creatures took control of the land. After reconnecting over the radio with his high school girlfriend, Aimee, who is now 80 miles away at a coastal colony, Joel begins to fall for her again. As Joel realizes that there\\'s nothing left for him underground, he decides to venture out to Aimee, despite all the dangerous monsters that stand in his way\". So was this movie a \"monster\" good time or a large-bore?Firstly, the characters are all great. Joel Dawson (Dylan O\\'Brien) is a very frightened and nervous individual but gradually grows more confident as the movie progress which is done convincingly. Later on, in the movie Joel meets two survivors on the surface, Clyde (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt), who eventually teach Joel the ropes on surviving. Clyde is the cool teacher and Minnow is the very loveable sidekick. The best addition to this movie is the pet dog \"Boy\" who goes with our main character Joel on his journey. \"Boy\" adds an extra layer to this movie by giving Joel, and the audience, someone to care about on the journey and leads to some intense moments. The director, Michael Matthews, made a great choice in including a companion for Joel as the movie wouldn\\'t have hit the same notes if it was just him. Also, dog companions are great anyway. There are some other characters like Aimee (Jessica Henwick), Joel\\'s goal, and they are all pretty good as well.I do have to give a lot of praise to Dylan O\\'Brien as he is very charming and charismatic despite playing a kind of nerdy loser type character. He makes Joel seem very relatable and successfully makes us root for him. There are also some surprisingly emotional moments sprinkled in this movie and Dylan\\'s performance is very good, to say the least in making us feel for him. There also some comedic moments and quips from our main character that for the most part land and none of it takes us out from the emotional core of the movie.Let\\'s talk about the monsters, they are great. They all have freaky designs but still, look reminiscent of the animals that they mutated from. The movie only has a few monster moments that appear but it works. Every moment where a monster appears is intense and suspenseful. There is also a great world-building and rules set in the movie that I particularly enjoyed. Not all monsters are the same as each monster have different ways to be dealt with and some monsters who are not as aggressive which was interesting.If I had to give a flaw to the movie then it has to be the predictability and the cliches in the movie. The story isn\\'t anything amazing and you can probably guess all the twist in this movie since it uses so many cliches that you would expect. Right from the first 10 minutes of the movie you can probably guess one of the twists near the end since it feels that incredibly cliche. The third act of this movie is not as good as the first two acts which were focused on the loneliness and struggle of our main character. The last act feels like a completely different movie with its over the top nature that is mostly dumb action rather than intense or suspenseful like the previous action set pieces.Overall, Love and Monster don\\'t do much new but that\\'s okay. In the end, the movie knows what it wants to be which is the growth of Joel on his journey with some monsters and it does that good. The movie has a lot of heart and sincerity that isn\\'t in a lot of movies nowadays. The movie is carried by a great performance from Dylan O\\'Brien and I hope to see more of him in the future. I had a surprisingly good time with this movie and I believe you will as well.',\n",

       "   \"* There is no end credit scene *The director Michael Matthews and crew brought a fun-loving comedic film. The story is by Brian Duffield and he has written a few movies I loved and now he has done it again. The story sets in a world filled with monsters and Joel makes a dangerous journey to be with the one he loves. The movie is a light charming adventure and having the lead character as the narrator makes everything feel more chipper. Also, the addition of the dog made it more enjoyable and he had so many great moments. As it is already mentioned in the title it is all about love while the monsters are the wall keeping them from it and this film shows how something impossible can be possible. It doesn't take it literally as a simple love, it is way bigger than that it directs on how to take risks to live the life you will love. I'm really eager for a sequel because this film needs one so desperately and hopefully next time they focus more on the monsters.The composers Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp gave this film the humor and the post-apocalyptic atmosphere with their music. It isn't something to grasp and yet it's just as simple to make this film work.The cast was incredible, Dylan O'Brien was hilarious as the narrator and his acting skills were spot on. Jessica Henwick was fantastic as well and I hope for a sequel for her to get more screen time. The storyline of them was perfectly executed there was no better way to unfold their story, loved how realistic it was. Now Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt were a badass-fun duo one of the best things this movie had. They were the backbone, without them the film could have gone into another route and of course, the dog also dominated every scene.\",\n",

       "   \"Films like this are very rare these days. The number of times a studio greenlights an original idea that has the feel of something that would've been in theatres over a decade or two ago is slim to none. Love and Monsters, although meant for the big screen, has just become available to watch at home and I feel that this gem of an adventure will go way under the radar. With a fun concept from start to finish and a real emotional core throughout, I had an absolute blast watching this film. Here's why Love and Monsters deserves your time.After attempting to save the planet, the human race accidentally created an apocalypse. Many years later, separated from his girlfriend, family, and now surviving with a group of warriors, Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) ventures out to find the love of his life. With the world now infested with giant, mutated insects, the journey will not be easy. The premise itself feels almost too familiar to fully enjoy, but the visuals make it feel unique and the fun tone and uplifting performance by O'Brien made it all worth it. I've also been a fan of his performances for some time now, so I may be a little biased in that regard.Love and Monsters takes the concept of characters being dropped into the apocalypse and spins it on its head. Just when you think it's about to get predictable, it pulls a little fast one and keeps you on your feet. Sure, some of the voiceovers can be a bit much and even a little distracting, but again, Dylan O'Brien is just a very likable actor and he sells pretty much any material he's ever given. At its core, this is a family adventure film, but it's also PG-13, so there is an emotional depth that gives it a layer I wasn't expecting. Yes, it's a little too tame sometimes, but I felt that gave it more charm.More than anything, I'm impressed that director Michael Matthews hadn't worked on anything of this scale before. His work here is miles ahead of many Hollywood directors coming out of the indie realm and I really hope he continues to get more work. It would be unfair if the improbable box office for this movie hurts his future chances. It's not that I absolutely loved this film or anything, but Matthews' touch was very apparent and the movie felt like it had a personality. That's something most Hollywood movies lack these days.In the end, as I said, this isn't anywhere near a perfect film, but it's the most fun I've had watching a new release in many months. If you're looking for something to immerse yourself in a world that's both unique and entertaining, Love and Monsters could very well be the film you need right now. I was invested in the character of Joel Dawson from beginning to end and the emotional core of the movie really worked for me. I watched this film with a giant grin on my face and right now, that's really all I can ask for, especially when the movie itself is well-made. Though it has faults throughout, I absolutely recommend checking out Love and Monsters, now available to stream on some services.\",\n",

       "   'Apocalyptic films are nothing new, but the view of \"Love and Monsters\" on this genre is a little more lighthearted and with a bit of humor. Directed by Michael Matthews, the film is based in a post-apocalyptic world where most of humanity has died and the world has been overtaken by giant creatures.This film reminded me a little bit of The Maze Runner, and not just because Dylan O\\'Brien is in the main role, but also that the main character knows little about an quite dangerous environment in which he is, that he is fearful and, it must be said, he is running everywhere. It seems that these running fragments were even filmed in a rather similar manner. \"Love and Monster\" isn\\'t with a very fresh concept, but the script and the charm of Dylan O\\'Brien make it a rather fun adventure comedy.Sometimes the environment was rather peaceful, even too peaceful, given that there should have been all sorts of creatures around everywhere. But in the end, this was comedy and the overall script was pretty good. So I will say that the film certainly deserves at least 7.Joel Dawson (Dylan O\\'Brien) is 24 years old and lives in an underground bunker with the group of survivors for the past seven years. When he restores contacts with his high-school girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick) over the radio, he makes a spontaneous decision to go to her colony, located 85 miles (~137 km) away, to meet his love again. It would be easy if Joel understood anything from survival outside the bunker, but it certainly doesn\\'t stop him from going. And then the adventure begins.During Joel\\'s journey, the environment is displayed in great expanses, many forests and mountains. Urban environments have been well overgrown (I think a bit too much for seven years). At the same time, the various creatures he encounters along the way have also been shown fairly well.When it comes to acting, it seemed mostly good, especially where Joel spoke to the dog he met as with a real person and expressed himself in a monologue, as well as in a conversation with Mavis (\"MAV1S\"), where his emotions were very well represented. The music didn\\'t stand out anywhere, though I liked the moment where Mavis played her final piece of music.In general, I would suggest that you do not go into the little details and don\\'t think so much about those dangers of apocalypse, but simply enjoy it. The film shows this all from a different point of view and the main thing you have to remember is that it\\'s an adventure comedy anyway. Enjoy!',\n",

       "   'Dylan O\\'Brien\\'s charisma goes the distance in the fleeting, but fun enough apocalypse adventure \"Love and Monsters,\" which has the actor navigating an obstacle course of convenient twists, unabashedly cute characters, and mega-sized creepy crawlies. He\\'s done well in a school of acting that has alums like Adam Brody and pre-Lars von Trier Shia LaBeouf-the art of being a little neurotic, with endearing self-deprecation taking the place of any stable cool-and this is an excellent display of O\\'Brien\\'s infectious imagination and comic energy. Plus, director Michael Matthews places him in a vivid apocalypse in which we\\'re the ones in danger of being squished, as towering centipedes, snails, and slugs and more have wiped out 95% of the human population.It\\'s a funny start then, how O\\'Brien begins \"Love and Monsters\" as a type of sidekick to a whole team of sexually active, bad-ass apocalyptic fighters, and he\\'s the chef. Vengeful, mutated animals might have been created from missiles that tried to shoot down a massive asteroid seven years ago, but some things in life are constant-some folk shack up with others quickly than others, and some people are much better at facing danger head-on. And then there\\'s O\\'Brien\\'s lonely Joel, whose main skill is that he makes a good minestrone soup.After he makes contact with an old love named Aimee (Jessica Henwick), who lives in a different colony 80 miles away, Joel decides to tackle the unknown danger of the outside world, and leave behind this makeshift family who seem to be in their own action movie. Everyone warns against it, knowing that he freezes when he\\'s been face-to-slimy-face with the monsters that have previously tried to break into the colony, but fear can be so tiring. Credit to \"Love and Monsters,\" it makes an intriguing hero flaw out of simply being too scared. Their survival of advice to Joel is a stern, \"Don\\'t fight. Just run and hide.\"By sheer determination to be with someone he first said \"I love you\" to right before the apocalypse, O\\'Brien\\'s Joel navigates his way through a new world, passing along cliff-sides that have been turned into honeycomb, and through suburbs that have been swallowed whole by the greenery of nature. While walking through a backyard, he\\'s attacked by a massive frog in a swimming pool, and is saved from its tongue by a quick-witted dog named Boy. It\\'s absolutely not the last time the movie will use convenient timing to save our hero, but it\\'s charming because of the dog, and the tight action sequence that unites them. The \"banter\" that O\\'Brien shares with the dog after is a delicate expression of Joel\\'s loneliness, and amicability. Boy is a good dog, and a good listener.Later on, Joel meets two more charming souls, who add character to the saga and not much else. But they share a good comedic chemistry, with Joel still as the clumsy underdog, who learns from the tough-as-nails kid Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt) about how to fire a crossbow, and Clyde (Michael Rooker) the secrets of surviving day by day. During their travels, Michaels spikes the goofiness with a few tense moments, not so much from grand surprise, but a festering dread. Especially as Joel\\'s flashbacks to seven years ago depict a gruesome end to everyone\\'s loved ones, \"Love and Monsters\" has a vital sense of danger, mixed with its interest in using O\\'Brien for some frantic slapstick.The script by Brian Duffield and Matthew Robinson (with story credit to Duffield) staples together its adventure together using voiceover and a whole batch of characters\\' good timing, but O\\'Brien\\'s Joel is a strong guide: he\\'s optimistic, excitable, and always likable. O\\'Brien helps give the movie a heart, and creates the movie\\'s need for connection in ways beyond finding his dream girl-he shares an unexpectedly sweet scene with a talking robot, which gives a sense of gravity that helps the later moments when he\\'s sprinting from an appropriately freaky centipede. \"Love and Monsters\" has a winning sincerity that helps it move along, even if you become more aware of just how narrow it is.Underneath everything, \"Love and Monsters\" has the feeling of a director auditioning for something of a \"Transformers\" movie, especially in its third act. The final showdown feels like a tacked-on calling card, but it\\'s another smoothly executed set-piece of people scrambling during a monster attack, with some hand-to-hand combat thrown in the mix. It\\'s also a good moment for the film\\'s sporadic use of practical effects, when all of the crags, slime, and moss on a monster makes them seem even larger in close-up, something you just don\\'t get from the other CGI creatures that chase people around in this story.But even more than for director Matthews, this is O\\'Brien\\'s showcase. He makes you believe that Joel is sprinting for his life from some fantastic beasts, and that throwing himself into an apocalypse to combat loneliness is noble enough. \"Love and Monsters\" openly tells you it\\'s not overthinking a single component, but with the spectacle of O\\'Brien\\'s athletic work, that\\'s not exactly the end of the world.',\n",

       "   \"The day of movies are currently loaded on to streaming and keeping up is much harder, nevertheless I'm doing my best to go over the latest and greatest films to hit the small screen. Tonight, the latest spoof, horror, adventure movie comes out in hopes of injecting a little life in the mundane works that have been coming out. So seeing the advertisements of this movie you might be thinking what I did, Will the dog survive? Okay maybe not that, but you might also be wondering... Is it good? Well my friends I'm here to give my input as another movie hits the media library in hopes of impressing. Robbie K here to review:Movie: Love and Monsters (2020)\\nDirector:\\nMichael Matthews\\nWriters:\\nBrian Duffield (screenplay by), Matthew Robinson(screenplay by)\\nStars:\\nDylan O'Brien, Jessica Henwick, Michael Rooker\\nLIKES:Decent Pace\\nGreat Introduction To the World\\nClever Creatures\\nGood CGI and world building\\nSome funny writing\\nSome good Emotional Scenes\\nSome Good Music To liven up Things\\nThe DogDislikes:Action Scenes Are lacking\\nPredictable\\nRushed Character Interactions\\nBackstory for many characters is pretty lame\\nMore Monsters Needed\\nSummary:Trying to be concise on this review, the movie surprisingly opens up well given all the bases it is trying to cover. A humorous cartoon drawing showing the world going to pot, the new Armageddon takes little time to get things going and drop you into the world of despair and big creatures. This pace continues, with little hesitation as Joel and his furry buddy go from point to point in their quest to find love and survive the horrors of the new world. Those horrors are really cool too see, mutated insects and amphibians with a true macabre design that has hints of human qualities, hybridization of other creatures, and the natural instincts of the creatures themselves. It works, and paints a horrifying set of monsters that if they existed would mean much trouble for the human race. The CGI to paint these creatures, and the world itself, is impressive for this movie, bringing the post-apocalyptic world to new realms of high definition details of despair.\\nNow amidst impressive CGI work that will snare you into its trap, the movie also brings about some other gimmicks to help cast that net wider and catch more groups. The writing is quirky, a combination of a self-depreciating monologue, some insult humor, and slapstick/fall down comedy that all mingles well. Other styles get thrown in here or there to help liven things up and it tries to keep the mood of the film as high as it can be given the material. Yet, there are emotional moments that will help bring most back into the film, in an attempt to bring you closer to the characters, or help gain some suspense in hopes you won't see your favorite character reduced to bloody remains. Add some music to help add edges to further liven things up, again a nice selection of components to help round out the movie. Though the part that kept me pulled into the movie the most was the dog. Yes, another display of impressive animal training, the dog kept me into the movie, with most of the suspense coming in the form of will the dog survive. I can't tell you the answer, but I loved the cute puppy in every shot and I think many will as well.Then comes the dislikes section of this predictable tale, the usual manners of a cool concept being pulled into a short time span resulting in some limited portrayals. For one thing the action scenes are rather boring, again most of the suspense geared towards the dog, as intense bouts of running from artificial creatures with loud sounds filled much of the film. Even those with combat scenes are rather limited, only a step above the SyFy channel original movies in terms of plot, build up and excitement. Thus, the action part needs a tune up for this reviewer, injecting close calls, good character involvement, and some major upgrades in suspense. . But you may not care about the action, you are drama lover who wants good characters well again those moments are kind of strewn. Joel's story is well done, but many of the other characters, as well as the relationships between them, is not as well developed as it could be. The compressed time frame has much to blame for this, as well as a potential budget for creature development, but I was rather bored with the rest of the characters. Sure some words of wisdom were shared, a few moments of hugging, and a few orchestra laden realizations have their moments. Yet, the rest is sort of background noise, who after their gimmicks are lost to the background for most of the movie. Given the casting they pulled in, I had hoped for more to help tell this tale. Again this is due to time, but perhaps planning this out, and not having a pandemic as well, could have helped strengthen the resolve.The VERDICT:Love and Monster is trying to impress a wide variety of people with their writing and CGI involvement and the promise of emotional, young love. On parts they succeed given all the circumstances with a well-designed world, gorgeous and creative creatures, and some well-timed comedy. Yet for the other parts, they manage to scratch the surface, promising more than they deliver in the run time provided to them. Love and Monsters almost needed a plan, and the money to support it, to make a planned series where emotional build up could have had time and we could have gotten more investment with our characters. This film almost felt like a good TV pilot or mini-series, and had they done that approach , many of the limitations would have greatly improved. Still, the movie breaks the mediocre movies I've seen at home, and I would give it a shot if you find the time for it. Otherwise, pray that blockbusters return to the theaters soon to help break the mundane films we've been getting.My scores are:Adventure/Comedy: 7.5\\nMovie Overall: 6.0\",\n",
